Incursion is an MIT Licensed InfluxDB client, written in Python, for developers.

The existing InfluxDB python client is great. This client is built on
that but many python developers have come to expect a programmatic
method for building queries on top of a raw unstructured query interface.

Incursion was built to bring a new pattern to your InfluxDB Queries.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> q = InfluxQuery.for_series('page_views')
    >>> q = q.columns(InfluxQuery.count(InfluxQuery.distinct('author_id')), 'author_id')
    >>> q = q.group_by(InfluxQuery.time('1h'))
    >>> q = q.where(category__matches=InfluxQuery.regex('/(10|11)/'))
    >>> from, to = (datetime(2014, 10, 20), datetime(2014, 10, 21))
    >>> q = q.where(time__gt=from, time__lt=to)
    >>> q = q.fill(0)
    >>> q = q.limit(None)
    >>> resp = INDBClient().result_from_query(q)
    >>> assert resp['page_views']
    >>> print '%(14)s %(6)s %(2)s' % ('time', 'count', 'id')
    >>> for row in resp['page_views']:
    >>>   print '%(-14)s %(-6)s %(-2)s' % (row.time, row.count, row.author_id)
    time          count id

    1413908730239 8     2

Features
--------

- Query Builder Pattern
- Lots of tests
- Safety first (all queries have a limit unless explicitly turned off)
- Ready for contributors (seriously, this should be a community project)

Installation
------------

To install Incursion, simply:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install incursion

Future Features
---------------

- Continuous Query Manager (fanouts and downsampling)
- In-app joining fanout query results to source series results
